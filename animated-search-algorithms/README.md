# Animated Search Algorithm

This project is a visualization of various search algorithms using React and React Spring for animation. It allows users to input an array of numbers, specify a target value to search for, and select between different search algorithms such as linear search and binary search. The search process is animated, showing the progress of the algorithm as it searches for the target value.

## Features

- Visualization of linear search and binary search algorithms.
- Dynamic input for array values and target value.
- Animation of the search process.
- Adjustable delay time for animation speed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14.x or later)
- npm (v6.x or later)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash

### Usage
1. Start the development server:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
2. Open your web browser and visit http://localhost:3000 to view the application.

3. Input an array of numbers and specify a target value to search for.

4. Select a search algorithm (linear search or binary search) from the dropdown menu.

5. Click the "Search" button to start the search process.
